## Vision!

The **Attendance Rewards** smart contract aims to streamline class attendance tracking and reward students based on their attendance using blockchain technology. By leveraging Ethereum's immutable ledger, this system ensures transparency and fairness in tracking attendance and awarding tokens.

## Features
- **Attendance Verification**: Teachers can mark students' attendance on the blockchain.
- **Token Rewards**: Students earn tokens once they meet the attendance threshold.
- **Immutable Records**: Attendance and reward records are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Flowchart
1. **Deployment**:
   - Teacher deploys the smart contract.
   - Contract deployer (teacher) sets up initial parameters.

2. **Mark Attendance**:
   - Teacher uses the `markAttendance` function to record student attendance.

3. **Claim Rewards**:
   - Students use the `claimReward` function to claim tokens after reaching the attendance threshold.

4. **Check Records**:
   - Both teacher and students use `getAttendance` and `getTokenBalance` to view attendance counts and token balances.

## Contract Address
- **Educhain Test Network Address**: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678` *(Replace with actual deployed address)*

## Future Scope
- **Enhanced Reward System**: Introduce varying reward levels based on attendance milestones.
- **Mobile Integration**: Develop a mobile app for easier interaction with the smart contract.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Implement detailed reporting features for attendance and rewards.
